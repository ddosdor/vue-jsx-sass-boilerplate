# @ddosdor/vue-jsx-sass-boilerplate
## What is this?

Because Vue is a very flexible framework, I decided to see how it will work with JSX.

## Why I made this?

For pure fun and verification of what else you can resurrect with Vue.

## Where to get it from?

From here. :)

Demo on Heroku - https://vue-jsx-sass-boilerplate.herokuapp.com/

## How to use this?

Clone this repo and:

```
yarn install
```

and

```
yarn serve
```

## What's next?

Maybe MobX, maybe JSS...
